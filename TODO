[ ] implement pragmas, don't just skip them
[ ] in a line-character comment, '}' should not be allowed immediately after ';'
[ ] right now, doc comments are only supported before procedures. is that good?
[ ] Param should take a pattern instead of an identifier
[ ] postfix operators need to handle opers other than ++ and --
        or deleted...
[ ] expressions should be transformed a lot before being converted to C
        example: `x + y` in souc is *not* the same as x + y in C
[ ] subroutines should also be converted (mapped?) to do the right thing.
[ ] generating params is really not implemented at all
[ ] don't always assume `int`, that was super lazy hacking
[ ] keep bindings of variables (not only constants)
[ ] shuntingyard uses `Parsec.string "<>"` which will explode if a < is read first
[ ] do bindings after program tree is built, not in the parser
[ ] remove postfix opers i think.
[ ] give NewType a smart constructor that prevents type names with lowercase first letter
[ ] make TypeError parameters always be in the right order with newtypes
    e. g. TypeError (Expect t) (Got t)
[ ] fix the data structure (or use smart constructors) for the Contexts. shadowing should be impossible.
[ ] top-level long procedures are assumed to be functions unless an IO signature is explicit
[ ] module name needs to match filename
[ ] shuntingyard stuff could probably use renaming. ASTree -> Expr_Tree ?
[ ] populate global scope first, then subscopes
        check test/parser.d/valid/bindings4.souc
[ ] consider using TaggedList or TaggedVector or VectorSized instead of NonEmpty
