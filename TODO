[ ] delete pragmas
[ ] in a line-character comment, '}' should not be allowed immediately after ';'
[ ] right now, doc comments are only supported before procedures. is that good?
[ ] delete doc comments?
[ ] Param should take a pattern instead of an identifier
[ ] decide the fate of ++ and --
[ ] generating params is really not implemented at all
[ ] don't always assume `int`, that was super lazy hacking
[ ] keep bindings of variables (not only constants)
[ ] shuntingyard uses `Parsec.string "<>"` which will explode if a < is read first
[ ] do bindings after program tree is built, not in the parser
[ ] make TypeError parameters always be in the right order with newtypes
    e. g. TypeError (Expect t) (Got t)
[ ] fix the data structure (or use smart constructors) for the Contexts. shadowing should be impossible.
[ ] top-level long procedures are assumed to be functions unless an IO signature is explicit
[ ] module name needs to match filename
[ ] shuntingyard stuff could probably use renaming. ASTree -> Expr_Tree ?
[ ] populate global scope first, then subscopes
        check test/parser.d/valid/bindings4.surc
[ ] consider using TaggedList or TaggedVector or VectorSized instead of NonEmpty
[ ] change different types of Map to HashMap
[ ] functions/procs can allocate but never free!
[ ] change type of procedures to Proc(args)
[ ] typeclasses
[ ] type inference
[x] `let` and `var`
[ ] `let` constants should have different semantics from `x = `  constants
[ ] `T -> IO` becomes `Proc(T)`
